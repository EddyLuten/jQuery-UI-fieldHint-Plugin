                    fieldHint Plugin for jQuery UI

What does it do?
----------------
This jQuery UI plugin allows you to mask HTML input fields with some text while
they are empty and don't have focus. The plugin reads the field's title
attribute for the hint to display, or the hint may be supplied explicitly
through an option.

Usage
-----
Include the 'jquery.ui.fieldHint.js' file on your page. You can apply this
plugin to either 'input' fields or 'textarea' fields like so:

$(selector).fieldHint();

Or with an optional options object:

$(selector).fieldHint({
  hint: 'Search...',
  hintClass: 'someClass',
  removeTitle: true
});

The 'hint' option sets the text to be displayed while the hint is visible if
this is not supplied, the hint displayed defaults to the field's title attri-
bute. The 'hintClass' option identifies the CSS class applied to the selected
fields while the hint is visible. If you set 'removeTitle' to true, it will
remove the title attribute from the field while the plugin is active.

See the subdirectory 'tests' for usage samples.
